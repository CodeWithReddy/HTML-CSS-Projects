Loading animations, also known as pre-loaders, loaders, or spinners, are visual cues that inform users your website is busy loading content. They are created using HTML and CSS.

HTML:- A section defines a document section with a heading. A simple div element is typically used in the HTML to define the space for the loader, while span groups inline content for styling or identification. 

CSS:- CSS styles are applied to the div to create the animation. This can involve using properties like border, border-radius, and animation to create various spinning or loading effects.

These animations provide a better user experience by:

* Indicating the website is working and not frozen.
* Reducing the perception of load time.
* Keeping users engaged while they wait.
