# HTML-CSS-Projects
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) projects involve creating and designing web pages. HTML provides the structure of the web pages using elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and forms. CSS is used to style and layout the HTML elements, defining aspects such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. These projects range from simple static web pages to complex multi-page websites, often incorporating responsive design techniques for compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.
